This is a group project completed for CSU33012 Software Engineering.

Run this webapp (pre-release) by cloning the repository and opening the terminal in the directory of the repository. Then, run 

    ./mvnw spring-boot:run

You can then open the current version on localhost:8080/calculator in your browser. To run the tests, run

    mvn test
        
This will be released on Docker hub at a later point.
